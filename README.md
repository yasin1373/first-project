analyzing the accuracy of different regression models when estimating particular variables. A variety of machine learning models are used to estimate four numerical variables based on sixteen input numerical variables.All in one pipeline are executed.So great insight into whether a model learns well from training and testing data or not. In addition, using K-fold cross validation guarantees unbiased selection of training and test data, which leads to a more valid model.
