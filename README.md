Comparing various regression models accuracy in estimating particular variables.Different machine learning models are used to estimate four numerical variables based on sixteen input numerical variables.All in one pipeline are executed, so great insight into whether a model learns well on train and test data or not.In addition,using   K-fold cross validation gurantees unbiased selection of train and test data which leads to a more valid model.
